    Trains a model using mini-batch gradient descent.

    Parameters:
    - network: the model to train
    - data: numpy.ndarray of shape (m, nx) containing the input data

    - batch_size: size of the batch used for mini-batch gradient descent
    - epochs: number of passes through data for mini-batch gradient descent
    - verbose: boolean that determines if output should be printed during training
    - shuffle: boolean that determines whether to shuffle the batches every epoch
